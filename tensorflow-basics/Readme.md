# TensorFlow Basics: Handwriting Recognition

This repository demonstrates the basics of using TensorFlow to build a handwriting recognition model using the MNIST dataset. It also includes an example of building the same model using Keras to showcase the simplicity and ease of using the Keras API.

## Features

- **TensorFlow Implementation**: A deep dive into building a model with TensorFlow from scratch for recognizing handwritten digits.
- **Keras Implementation**: A simplified implementation using Keras to compare and highlight its ease of use.
